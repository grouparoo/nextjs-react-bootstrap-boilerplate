## NextJS/React Bootstrap Boilerplate Project

This project was created to use in tandem with our tutorial on [building a responsive navbar mega menu]() and for general front end developer fiddling.

[Here](https://vercel.com/grouparoo/nextjs-react-bootstrap-boilerplate/rxjPb8mBNy4FNCprjKiopiwsAX2P) is what we start with.

And [here](https://nextjs-react-bootstrap-boilerplate-ddnkxycta-grouparoo.vercel.app/) is the finished Navbar with the Mega Menu
